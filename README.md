Mixmaster is an anonymous remailer first developed in the 1990s by Lance Cottrell.

Mixmaster 3.1 is a version with 4096 bit RSA Encryption and other features not present before 2013.

New in version 3.1 is the possibility to make a Debian package, a systemd startup file to run with mixmaster -D and a cron job to update stats and keys from a source (mixmin as default).
